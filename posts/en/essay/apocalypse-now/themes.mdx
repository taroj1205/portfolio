### Introduction 

The Vietnam War Film Apocalypse Now directed by Francis Ford Coppola is a powerful text that delivers his powerful messages for the viewer about war and humanity. This is his primary concern however he achieves this through the creation of stunning visual and verbal effects. Captain Willard is the protagonist in this film who is on a mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz who has gone insane. Through this journey, as Willard travels up the river to Kurtz’s base, the effects of war on its participants are revealed and how war reveals the dark side in ourselves and reject war as a solution to conflict. These powerful messages are presented using a skilful combination of verbal and visual techniques. 

### Body Paragraph 1 

In the film’s powerful opening scene, Coppola helps us understand how war damages its participants psychologically using a stunning combination of visual and verbal effects. Although he uses these visual and verbal effects effectively, the main purpose is to deliver his powerful messages to the viewer. The scene starts with Willard drunk and unhinged in the Saigon Hotel room. Saigon is a place far from the battlefield, and he is waiting for another mission. Coppola skilfully uses complex camera work to show an inverted image of Willard’s face superimposed over images of burning jungle and battle scenes. This suggests that Willard’s life has been turned upside down by his experiences in war and war has become part of who he is. Coppola combines this camera work with Willard’s lifeless narrative voice over to show how he has been affected by war. “When I was here, I wanted to be there; when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said “yes” to a divorce. We understand how much he has been psychologically damaged by war, how he has tried to return to his civilian life but has been unable to, because he can only think about war. Coppola further emphasises Willard’s fragile psychological state by using another insightful technique of symbolic action to end the scene. As Willard does a drunken martial art dance, he punches the mirror smashing his reflection and symbolically destroying himself before collapsing next to his bed covered in blood. This symbolic action is used to show how war has corrupted his mind to a level where he is self-destructive. We can only guess that he has driven by remorse or guilt for his actions in war. The intense background music of ‘The End’ by the doors plays throughout the scene adding to the feeling of chaos and insanity. Coppola effectively uses these techniques to help us understand a powerful message of how war can damage its participants on a psychological level, and how this damage affects people even after they leave the battlefield. As society we must know that when we send men to war, they come back damaged, and that we must help them cure the damage as the effects can last a long time. 

### Body Paragraph 2 

Coppola exposes how war morally corrupts its participants in the Sampan Massacre scene again using stunning visual and verbal effects. In this scene, Captain Willard and his crew encounter a boat full of civilians. Willard tries to prioritize his mission and ignore this boat, but Chief insists on searching it; a woman makes a sudden movement and the agitated crew open fire. Close-ups of the crews’ faces as they gun down the innocent civilians show their hate filled facial expressions suggesting they have lost their humanity in the moral fog of war. A wounded woman is left alive, and Coppola uses dialogue and symbolic action to underline the moral ambiguity of war. Chef says, “it says in the book...”. Chef wants to follow the rules of war by taking the wounded woman to the nearest medical facility. Before he can finish Willard executes the woman with a shot to the head saying, “I told you not to stop”. Willard justifies murder as a way to prioritize his mission showing how violent he had become and how morally corrupted he was while Chief holds on to his morality by relying on the rules of war. This scene ends with the back lighting of Willard sitting on the edge of the boat with the sun setting behind him. As the sun sinks, the use of back lighting technique symbolises how the dark side of Willard is slowly taking over him. Coppola masterfully shows how war corrupts its participants morally and exposes the dark side in humanity through these stunning effects. War can confuse us and make us do what we would not have done, and perhaps remind us that we have dark side. We need to be aware as a society that not only war damages us psychologically, physically, but also corrupts us morally. 

### Body Paragraph 3 

Finally in the film’s powerful climax and falling action, Coppola again reveals how war exposes the darkest side of humanity, but we have a choice to reject this side of ourselves using stunning visual and verbal effects. In this scene, Willard, whose darkest side has emerged, completes his mission by butchering Kurtz with the symbolic prop of a machete. A close up of Willard rising from the river presents Willard as a creature of the dark, his mud caked face reminds us of Kurtz when he killed and decapitated Chef. Cross cutting is used to compare Willard butchering Kurtz to Kurtz’s followers ritually sacrificing a buffalo suggesting that Kurtz must die as he has become less than human in his actions in the war. After Willard butchers Kurtz a close up and chiaroscuro lighting shows how half of Willard’s face is covered in shadow, and the other half bright symbolising his choice of embracing his darkest side and replacing Kurtz or rejecting this side of himself and leaving. The director Coppola is both suggesting that we like Willard or have a duality of good and evil within us and also questioning us what would we do if we were Willard? Willard is holding two symbolic props in this scene, a machete that he used to kill Kurtz which symbolise death, violence and destruction and a manuscript symbolising hope, purity and civilization. He drops the machete in a symbolic action, rejecting the dark side and leaves the base. He also turns off the radio asking for a confirmation of an airstrike to destroy the base and all who remain, showing how he has learned that death and destruction and indeed war is not the answer from what he experienced and done. With this, Coppola perfectly uses these stunning visual and verbal effects to show how war can reveal the dark side in ourselves, but we have a choice, and the choice is to reject that dark side, and reject war as a solution to conflict. As a society, we must reject war as a solution to conflict, and violence should never be a way to solve conflict. 

### Conclusion 

In conclusion, director Coppola has masterfully delivered his powerful messages about war through the use of stunning visual and verbal effects. The viewer can learn from this powerful film about how war can damage its participants psychologically, and physically, corrupt their morality and expose the darkest side of humanity, but we have a choice to reject that dark side and reject war as a solution to solve conflict. As a society we must question ourselves, if war has such negative effects on its participants, why do we still send people to war and what can we do to help them overcome these effects. As I write this essay wars rage in Europe and the middle East which atrocities being reported on a daily basis... Coppola’s messages about war have seemed so relevant!
