### Introduction

The Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now directed by Francis Ford Coppola is a powerful text that delovers his purpose through the use of complex technical features. Captain Willard is a protagonist in this film who is on a mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz who has gone insane. Through this journey, as Willardtravels up the river, the effects of war on its participants are revealed and how war reveals the dark side in ourselves, but we have a choice to reject war and the dark side in ourselves, rejecting war as a solution to conflict.

### Body Paragraph 1

In the film's powerful opening scene, Coppola uses a complex combination of film techniques to emphasize the psychological damage caused by war. The scene starts with Willard psychologically damaged in the Saigon hotel room. Saigon is a place far from the battlefield, and he is waiting for another mission. 

> Every time I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said "yes" to a divorce.

> When I was here, I wanted to be there; when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now... waiting for a mission... getting softer. Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around the walls moved in a little tighter.

This narrative-voice-over is used to show how much he was psychologically damaged by war, and how he can only think about war even though he should be feeling safe in the hotel room. This is followed by Willard being drunk, and as he starts to do a martial art dance, he symbolically self-destructs himself by punching and smashing the mirror with his reflection, and collapsing next to his bed covered in blood. This symbolic action is used to show how war has corrupted him and damaged him on a psychological level. Coppola effectively combines the complex technical features to create a powerful text with a message to the viewer about how war can damage its participants on a psychological level, and how this damage affects people even after they leave the battlefield. As a society we must know that when we send men to war, they come back damaged, and that we must help tem cure the damage as the effects can last a long time.

### Body Paragraph 2

In another powerful scene of Sampan Massacre scene, Coppola again used a complex combination of film techniques to expose how war morally corrupts its participants. In this scene, Captain Willard and his crew encounters a family on a bot. Willard tries to prioritize his mission and ignore this family, but the crew started inspecting the boat. With close up of the crews faces as they spectate the boat, it showed how they got frustrated and they started to randomly shoot the gun, which killed all the family members apart from a woman who got wounded.

> It says in the book.

The use of this dialogue shows how with the help of the book that has the rules of war, Chef was able to come back to himself and tried to take the wounded woman the hospital to get her a medical help as the book states.

> I told you not to stop

This was followed by Willard executing the wounded woman showing how violent he had become and how morally corrupted he was. This scene ends with the back lighting of Willard sitting on the edge of the boat with a sun setting behind him. As the sun sinks, the use of this back lighting technique shows how the dark side of Willard is slowly taking over him. Coppola masterfully uses these complex technical features to show how war corrupts its participants morally, and exposes the dark side in the humanity. This powerful scene has described Coppola's idea effectively on how wra can make us do what we would not have done, and we perhaps have dark side in ourselves. We need to be aware as a society that not only war damages us psychologically, physically, but also corrupts us morally.

### Body Paragraph 3

In the film's powerful climax and faling action, Coppola again uses a complex combination of film techniques to reveal how war reveals our darkest side of humanity, but we have a choice. In this scene, Willard whose darkest side is induldged comples his mission by butchering Kurtz with a symbolic prop of machete. With the use of contrasting lighting as Willard butchers Kurtz, the viewer is shown how both Willard and Kurtz have allowed their darkest side to indulge as we can barely see them. "The horror, the horror..." This dialogue of Kurtz is used as he dies showing how the word 'horror' was the only thing he could say after everything he has done. After he butchers Kurtz, he is forced to make a decision whether or not he replaces Kurtz, kill Kurtz's followers or leave the base, through the use of close up and chairoscuro lighting showing how half of Willard's face is covered in dark shadow, and the other half bright. Willard is holding two symbolic props in this scene, machete that he used to kill Kurtz which symbolise death, violence and destruction and a manuscript symbolising hope, peace, purity and civilization. He drops the machete in a symbolic action, rejecting the dark side and leaves the base. He also turns off the radio asking for a confirmation of an airstrike to the village, showing how he has learned from what he has experienced and done. With this, Coppola perfectly creates a powerful text through complex technical features showing how war can reveal the dark side in ourselves, but we have a choice, and the choice is to reject that dark side, and reject war as a solution to conflict. As a society, we must reject war as a solution to conflict. As a society, we must remember that there is always another solution to conflict and violence should never be a way to solve conflict.

### Conclusion

As a conclusion, director Coppola has effective,y masterfully, and perfectly created a very powerful anti-war film through the use of complex technical features, and also delivers his message, and purpose about war. The viewer can learn from this film how war can damage us psychologically, and physically, corrupt us morally and expose the darkest side of humanity and ourselves, but we have a choice to reject that dark side and reject war as a way to solve conflict. As a socieyt we must question ourselves, if war has such negative effects on its participants, why do we still send people to war and what can we do to help them overcome these effects.
