Throughout my life, I've experienced various significant events, from relocating due to natural disasters to undergoing knee surgery. In the realm of technology, I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions. I'm skilled in web development, using technologies like React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to craft modern and responsive applications. I also have experience with database management using Supabase. Let's build amazing digital experiences together!

## Hobby

### Jump Rope

From my early years in primary school, jump rope has been a captivating activity for me. I've refined my skills to the point where I can execute 30 successive double jumps, and even accomplish 10 crossed double jumps in a single sequence.

### Kendama
Kendama, a traditional Japanese game that involves balancing a ball and a "sword", has been a favorite pastime of mine since my primary school days. My proficiency has grown to the point where I can juggle with the Kendama and still land it.

### Reading News
Keeping abreast of current events is a daily habit of mine. I find reading news to be both informative and engaging.

### Table Tennis

Table tennis is a sport I truly enjoy. My journey with the game began in earnest in April 2023, and since then, I've been consistently playing at least once a week.

### Soccer (Football)

I have played soccer for fun with my friends for a long time until I had an ACL injury in July 2020.

## Education

I currently plan to take double major in Computer Science and IT Management at University of Auckland.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on.

### Python

I made a typing game that would help the user learn English vocabularies through playing typing game. [https://github.com/taroj1205/Learn-Vocabs-Through-Typing](https://github.com/taroj1205/Learn-Vocabs-Through-Typing)

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>
- When the program is launched, it will automatically create the necessary folders and text files if they do not exist.
- If the entered word is correct, the score will be increased.
- If the entered word is incorrect, the score will be decreased.
- The current score and the number of presented words will be displayed on the screen. Additionally, the number of previously presented words is displayed in the top left corner. The most recent word is marked with `<`, making it easier to identify the last word entered.
- The score and word count can be reset using the <Kbd keys={["escape"]} text="ESC" /> key. Before resetting, the previous score and word count are automatically backed up and saved in the data folder as `data Year-Month-Date Hour-Minute-Seconds (backup).txt`. The history of presented words is saved as `words Year-Month-Date Hour-Minute-Seconds (backup).txt`, and the number of correct and incorrect answers is saved as `accuracy Year-Month-Date Hour-Minute-Seconds (backup).txt`.
- At the end of the game, the score and word count are saved in the data folder as data.txt, the history of presented words is saved as words.txt, and the number of correct and incorrect answers is saved as accuracy.txt. These files are automatically loaded when the program is launched.

### C# (with Unity)

I have made a 2D Typing Game with Unity. This is a rewritten version of the previously made Python typing game.
[https://github.com/taroj1205/Typing-Game](https://github.com/taroj1205/Typing-Game)

I have written a Japanese [blog](https://taroj1205.hatenablog.com/archive/category/%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%94%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0) about me developing this game as well.

</video>

### JavaScript (Flask)

I have made a JavaScript version of the typing game I made with python, and C#. [https://github.com/taroj1205/taroj1205.github.io/tree/main/typing](https://github.com/taroj1205/taroj1205.github.io/tree/main/typing)

I have hosted the game with the github.io. This uses flask to get/save the user data which uses SQLite3.

Client side is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
