## Hobby

### Jump Rope

From my early years in primary school, jump rope has been a captivating activity for me. Over time, I've refined my skills to the point where I can execute 30 successive double jumps, and even accomplish 10 crossed double jumps in a single sequence.

### Kendama
Kendama, a traditional Japanese game that involves balancing a ball and a "sword", has been a favorite pastime of mine since my primary school days. My proficiency has grown to the point where I can juggle with the Kendama.

### Reading News
Keeping abreast of current events is a daily habit of mine. I find reading news to be both informative and engaging.

### Table Tennis

Table tennis is a sport I truly enjoy. My journey with the game began in earnest in April 2023, and since then, I've been consistently playing at least once a week.

### Soccer (Football)

I have played soccer for fun with my friends for a long time until I had an ACL injury in July 2020.
