I have a keen interest in coding, especially using:

- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

I also enjoy hobbies like:

- Jump rope
- Kendama
- Reading news
- Table tennis

### My Experiences

Throughout my life, I've experienced various significant events, from relocating due to natural disasters to undergoing knee surgery.

## Hobby

### Jump Rope

From my early years in primary school, jump rope has been a captivating activity for me. I've refined my skills to the point where I can execute 30 successive double jumps, and even accomplish 10 crossed double jumps in a single sequence.

### Kendama
Kendama, a traditional Japanese game that involves balancing a ball and a "sword", has been a favorite pastime of mine since my primary school days. My proficiency has grown to the point where I can juggle with the Kendama and still land it.

### Reading News
Keeping abreast of current events is a daily habit of mine. I find reading news to be both informative and engaging.

### Table Tennis

Table tennis is a sport I truly enjoy. My journey with the game began in earnest in April 2023, and since then, I've been consistently playing at least once a week.

### Soccer (Football)

I have played soccer for fun with my friends for a long time until I had an ACL injury in July 2020.

## Education

I currently plan to take double major in Computer Science and IT Management at University of Auckland.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on.

### Python

I made a typing game that would help the user learn English vocabularies through playing typing game. [https://github.com/taroj1205/Learn-Vocabs-Through-Typing](https://github.com/taroj1205/Learn-Vocabs-Through-Typing)

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>
- When the program is launched, it will automatically create the necessary folders and text files if they do not exist.
- If the entered word is correct, the score will be increased.
- If the entered word is incorrect, the score will be decreased.
- The current score and the number of presented words will be displayed on the screen. Additionally, the number of previously presented words is displayed in the top left corner. The most recent word is marked with `<`, making it easier to identify the last word entered.
- The score and word count can be reset using the <Kbd keys={["escape"]} text="ESC" /> key. Before resetting, the previous score and word count are automatically backed up and saved in the data folder as `data Year-Month-Date Hour-Minute-Seconds (backup).txt`. The history of presented words is saved as `words Year-Month-Date Hour-Minute-Seconds (backup).txt`, and the number of correct and incorrect answers is saved as `accuracy Year-Month-Date Hour-Minute-Seconds (backup).txt`.
- At the end of the game, the score and word count are saved in the data folder as data.txt, the history of presented words is saved as words.txt, and the number of correct and incorrect answers is saved as accuracy.txt. These files are automatically loaded when the program is launched.

### C# (with Unity)

I have made a 2D Typing Game with Unity. This is a rewritten version of the previously made Python typing game.
[https://github.com/taroj1205/Typing-Game](https://github.com/taroj1205/Typing-Game)

I have written a Japanese [blog](https://taroj1205.hatenablog.com/archive/category/%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%94%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0) about me developing this game as well.

</video>

### Flask (JavaScript)

I have created a JavaScript version of the typing game that was originally developed using Python and C#. The game can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/taroj1205/taroj1205.github.io/tree/main/typing).

I have hosted the game on GitHub Pages. The server-side uses Flask to handle user data, which is stored in SQLite3.

The client-side of the game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here's a snippet of the server-side code:

For more details, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/taroj1205/taroj1205.github.io/tree/main/typing).

### Node.js (JavaScript)

I have transitioned to using Node.js for my project and have made changes to how data is fetched. Instead of using saved data, I now import the data from the Quizlet API.

Here's a preview of the code:

![index_js.webp](/blog/about/index_js.jpg)

With this code, I make an asynchronous request to the Quizlet API and fetch the data based on the provided `id`. The response is then logged to the console, and the relevant data is extracted and returned.

The client-side of the game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/taroj1205/Typing-Game-Node/) for more details.

### Next.js + React.js

Currently, my preferred framework is Next.js and React.js. I am grateful to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for providing hosting services for my projects using these technologies.

#### taroj.poyo.jp
I have started to learn Next.js and React.js. The first project I have made was [taroj.poyo.jp](https://taroj.poyo.jp/) on pages directory. I also tried adding a login system (with MySQL on PlanetScale but later switched to Supabase PostgreSQL) but it was only used for saving and loading data for managing NCEA. Access the app [here](https://taroj.poyo.jp/apps/ncea/).

#### Chat app

I have also made a chat app using Supabase. The project is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/taroj1205/chat). This has a lot of different features such as:

- Authentication
- Realtime database
- Realtime messaging
- Storage
- Channels
- Creating/Deleting/Editing:
  - Channels
  - Messages
- Editing usernames/profile picture
- Right click menu
  - Reply
  - Edit
  - Copy
  - Delete
- Admin/Moderator system

#### taroj.vercel.app

As I tried to do a lot of new things everytime on [taroj.poyo.jp](https://taroj.poyo.jp/), the website started to load slower, and I thought I added too many things to complicate things. The locale system I was using changed its content language after the user loads the page, which resulted in a content change everytime. So I decided to completely rewrite the project. The project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/taroj1205/portfolio) as well. It uses Next.js 13 and on app directory. It is the website you are currently on.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my journey of relocating to different countries, pursuing education, and my passion for coding has been a continuous learning experience. I have gained valuable experience working with various technologies and have successfully completed projects that I am proud of. My personal interests and hobbies, such as jump rope, kendama, and staying updated with news, have also played a significant role in shaping my personality.

Moving forward, I am excited to continue advancing in the tech industry, enhancing my skills, and contributing to innovative projects. I am eager to connect with other professionals in the field, learn from their experiences, and share my own. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Let's connect and collaborate to create something remarkable together!
